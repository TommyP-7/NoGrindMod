# NoGrindMod
- Small QoL Mod conceived mainly to reduce the grinding in D2R and respect your time.
- Keeps things as close to the vanilla experience as possible, while minimizing time-related inconveniences.
- Designed for use with D2RLAN's base TCP files - v2.4 of the game (a must).
- I created this mod for myself but decided to release it for people who also have limited time but are passionate about Diablo 2.

# Changes

Below you will find all the changes made by this mod, segmented into categories.

### Farming Changes
- Greatly increased High Rune drop chances, but still maintaining balance.
- Andariel can now be farmed for gems in the following way:
  - Normal: High chance to drop Normal Gems
  - Nightmare: High chance to drop Flawless Gems
  - Hell: High chance to drop Perfect Gems
- Hell Radament can now be farmed for Rainbow Facets.
- Hell Duriel can now be farmed for Sunder Charms.
- Hell Countess, Nihlathak, and Summoner now drop their Keys 10x more often.
- The Countess can drop higher Runes in the following way (3 Runes guaranteed per kill):
  - Normal Limit (Including): KO Rune
  - Nightmare Limit (Including): VEX Rune
  - Hell Limit (Including): ZOD Rune
- Council Members in Travincal can now be farmed for Gold - they drop 4x the base amount.
- The Cow King in Hell difficulty now has a high chance to drop the Gheed's Fortune Grand Charm.

### Gamble Changes
- All item types can now be gambled (including Charms and Jewels).
- Gambling now functions as follows: Normal items on Normal diffifulty, Exceptional on Nightmare, Elite on Hell.
- Gambling can now be part of the game loop (optional), because it is very lucrative - Set/Unique/Rare items are now much easier to gamble. This way, Gold plays a massive role in acquiring gear, if the player so chooses.

- Added a custom item called "Runic Elixir" to all Gamble NPCs. They can be bought for 50,000+ Gold and when right clicked, they give you a random rune based on your character level. This also adds to Gold being a direct factor in acquiring gear while also remaining optional. It is also a new Horadric Cube ingredient.
