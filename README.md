# NoGrindMod
- QoL Mod to reduce the grinding in D2R and respect your time + some minor changes.
- Keeps things as close to the vanilla experience as possible, while minimizing time-related inconveniences.
- Designed for use with D2RLAN.
- I created this mod for myself but decided to release it for people who also have limited time but are passionate about Diablo 2.

## Changes

Below you will find all the changes made by this mod, segmented into categories.

### Gamble Changes
- All item types can now be gambled (including Charms and Jewels).
- Gambling now functions as follows: Normal items on Normal diffifulty, Exceptional on Nightmare, Elite on Hell.
- Gambling can now be part of the game loop (optional), because it is very lucrative - Set/Unique/Rare items are now much easier to gamble. This way, Gold plays a massive role in acquiring gear, if the player so chooses.
