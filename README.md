# NoGrindMod
- Small QoL Mod conceived mainly to reduce the grinding in D2R and respect your time.
- Keeps things as close to the vanilla experience as possible, while minimizing time-related inconveniences.
- Designed for use with D2RLAN.
- I created this mod for myself but decided to release it for people who also have limited time but are passionate about Diablo 2.

# Changes

- Added a custom item called "Runic Elixir" to all Gamble NPCs. They can be bought for 50,000+ Gold and when right clicked, they give you a random rune based on your character level. This also adds to Gold being a direct factor in acquiring gear while also remaining optional. It is also a new Horadric Cube ingredient.
